#### :pencil: Bio:
Before launching my career into the tech industry, I gained valuable experiences in different fields of works. I was a neutrino lab research assistant, Electronics Repair Specialist, Localization/Translator, etc. I've acquired a vast skill set that I can translate into a software engineering role, such as attention to details, good time manamgement and planning, data analytics, being a teamplayer, etc.

I'm a natural problem solver, having worked with modern electronic hardware and been a research assistant in Drexel's Physics Laboratory allows me to tackle complex problems with a solutions-oriented mindset. I also have a passion in music and creative digital art, which adis my creative front-end side of web development. I'm fluent in 4 languages Japanese, English, Chinese and Fuzhounese. I've developed great communication skills through out my work with international companies. Learning a programming language is a lot like learning a new spoken language, it comes very natural to me. I'm always open to share my knowledge and experience with others, and am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.

Thank you for visiting my profile. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out.
